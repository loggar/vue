		All lifecycle hooks are called with their this context pointing to the Vue instance invoking it.

		Don’t use arrow functions on an options property or callback, such as

		created: () => console.log(this.a)
		or
		vm.$watch('a', newValue => this.myMethod()).

		Since arrow functions are bound to the parent context, this will not be the Vue instance as you’d expect, often resulting in errors such as
		
		Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined
		or
		Uncaught TypeError: this.myMethod is not a function.
